🔍 FitFinder – Your Daily Outfit Assistant

Overview:
FitFinder is a terminal-based fashion recommendation program that helps users decide what to wear based on the weather and personal preferences. It simulates a real-life “what should I wear today?” assistant.

How it works:
The program asks for user input including:
	•	Temperature (°C)
	•	Style preference (e.g. casual, business formal, cute, etc.)
	•	Color tone (dark or light)
	•	Optional: specific color
	•	Weather condition (e.g. rainy)

Using these inputs, the program recommends a complete outfit (top, bottom, and shoes) from a preset virtual wardrobe. If no specific color is chosen, one will be selected at random based on tone.

There is also a Quick Mode, which instantly generates a random outfit with no input required. Users can request alternative suggestions until satisfied.

Features:
	•	Smart input validation
	•	Re-pick functionality
	•	Weather-aware reminders (e.g. umbrella alerts on rainy days)
	•	Fully object-oriented Python design
